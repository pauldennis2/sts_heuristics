1. Created a basic analysis for strategies. See below for feature suggestions.

2. Added analysis of conditions.
	Conditions that are never triggered are saved and never used again
	Good conditions (ones that improve outcome) are saved and re-used in the future
	
3. Learned a lesson about luck. While the average variability with 500 runs might be around 0.1, in practice variability can be as high as 2.5-3.0 (if very lucky/unlucky).

4. Changed constructor and tweak() for AdaptiveStrategy to reuse old successful conditions.
Todo:
