Design ideas to make the game more complex:

1. Add powers. This gives more potential in later fights which last longer.

2. Make monster damage less indomitable. Possibly after level 10 monster damage rises at a level of 1/2 levels

3. Add other new cards or effects?

OK, new power cards (uncommon)

Every turn, deal x damage.
Every turn, heal x.
Every turn, block x.
Immune to status ailments
Increase strength by 2
Increase dexterity by 2

Starting at level 15, monsters gain one of the following:
Damage reduction 1
Weakening attacks (monsters attacks reduce your damage to 80%)
Heal 2 per turn
Increase str by 1 per turn
Vulnerable attacks (monsters attack increases your damage taken by 5% for the rest of the round)
Grow hp (hp *= 1.3)

At 25, monsters gain another ability

Closing notes for Friday:
The Hall of Fame problem seems to be solved!
But we are not making any progress on finding better strategies.

Monster abilities are almost fully added to the game.
In the process of adding "powers" into the game.
	The "strength" and "damage" powers may be a pain because a hero (unlike a monster) doesn't have damage - they have cards.
	
Most fields are private now - wouldn't hurt to check around and just make this universal.

Todos (in addition to above):
Expand DeckReport to analyze powers.
Make this its own project and add a readme.md
Work on documentation
Long-term - write out the game parameters to file
	How much damage basic strikes do, how fast monster hp grows, etc
	How much upgraded cards gain
	How much dual function cards do (i.e. strike + block does 4 of each rather than 5)
	Some of these properties are just simple numbers and can be easily read from file (such as the value of upgrades - it's a simple static value)
	Other properties (like monster damage growth rate) are more complex and probably not worth writing to file
