1. Raised high water mark from 56.2 -> 57.9

2. Changed the high-water mark file to be more informative.

3. Added optimization to check after 100 runs. If we're not even close, just skip the next 400.

4. Made the process reactive (if it hasn't improved, it gets more "desperate" and tries harder).

5. Identified that there IS for sure a problem with how the attainments are calculated/stored.
	Top strategy's attainment is marked as ~56 but actual average is closer to 20.
	
6. Created Readme.md and added a lot of description.
