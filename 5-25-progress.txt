Accomplished:

1. Proved that threading does not prevent writing results

2. Added DEFAULT_STRIKE_BLOCK_MAGNITUDE as a basis for creating cards. Imperfect, but a start.

3. Balance changes:
	At level 45 heroes choose a bonus (based on strategy)
		One-time HP increase, per turn HP increase, 30% more powerful blocks, or an extra action per turn
	At level 45 damage scaling increases back to level * 0.75 (Currently reduced to level * 0.5 at level 8)
	At level 50, the hero is presented with increased choices
		High level choices 2 -> 3
		Card choices 2 reg, 1 power -> 3 reg, 2 power
		
4. Woot! Refactored out the static functionality of ClimbingGame into its own class (GameRunner).
This creates good separation of concern between running an individual game (ClimbingGame's responsibility) and managing breeding strategies and recording results (GameRunner's responsibility).

5. HOF no longer saves if empty

6. Solved exponential name growth problem (at the cost of some data loss - well worth it)

7. Added high water mark tracking.

8. Slight change to how the strategy tweaks the values (doesn't need to throw out whole list now)

Todo:

Solve the mystery of why going from 40 hp to 400 had no effect on achievement

Change how parent names are created (they're getting too long)
	Bonus - doesn't require throwing out HOF data
	
Find out why gritty data seems inconsistent with hall of fame (average for top strat came out to 24)
