1. Created a true cross-breeding method.

2. Tweaked existing breeding methods to use (1) and spend a lot less time on newly created strategies.

3. Designed and implemented the unused condition purge. If a condition is unused in 3000 runs, it's removed
	Right now only for HOF but could be extended to Potentials without trouble

Todo:

Write an analyzer for the HOF strategies
Possibly analyze conditions that don't matter - but this is complicated and probably less fruitful
