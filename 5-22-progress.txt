Progress today

Changed the way the "results" from the conditionsAndResultsMap work.
It's now conditionsAndValues, and instead of having a list of strings it has a Map<String, Double> which is then sorted later.

This allows for a lot more flexibility in creating conditions because they don't have to change the whole list, they can just make one thing more or less important.

Todo:
Change the tweak functionality of AdaptiveStrategy to take advantage of CompositeConditions.
	Sometimes take an existing condition (or two?) and make it composite
	Sometimes create a new composite condition
