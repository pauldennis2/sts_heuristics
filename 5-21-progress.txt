1. Generified Condition into Conditional interface.

2. Now supports complex conditions with and/or (can be nested, so (A || B) && C is possible)

3. Changed the "tweak" mechanic to be an interface instead of repeated constructor methods

4. Expanded DeckReport to have new fields based on information on powers

5. Added time-out to combat (if not over in 30 rounds, the player loses)

6. Tested monster abilities (mostly seems to be working)

7. Added implementation for powers (mostly)

To-do:

1. Fix rounding error with monster abilities weakening attacks & vuln attacks

2. Finish implementation of powers and test

3. Implement ability to choose powers

High-level todo:

I. Be able to write out game parameters to file (see design notes)

II. Change the list of preferences to be weighted rather than just a straight list
	For example we can say that a condition adjusts the value of healing down to 0.5 or down by 0.5
	
III. True unit tests

IV. Documentation, readme
