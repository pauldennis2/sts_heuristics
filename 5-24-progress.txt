Factors that made ribbon undesirable:

Monster abilities only came up starting on level 15
Monster abilities weren't that threatening
Only 1/3 of abilities were status effects - if they didn't have a status effect, dead card
Always prioritized for upgrading and it has no worth

Changes

Monster abilities gained at level 10, 25, 40, 50 (formerly 15, 25, 40)
Vuln factor 0.05 -> 0.1
Weak factor 0.04 -> 0.05
Upgrade now removes any existing status effects
Added poison (take increasing damage each round)
Status effects no longer drop off after level 50
If a monster rolls a status effect ability twice it'll be re-rolled

Increased power of the base deck (strikes/blocks do 6, was 5)
Increased value of heal to 6

*Changed last monster ability to level 60 (too many strategies died on early 50s)

Speed Notes:
Takes around 6 minutes to run through the full breeding strategy

Games per run: 1,540,000

Looking for ways to speed up the process:
	Use a thread pool for each strategy
	After 100 runs, evaluate the strategy. If it's not close, stop
	
Used thread pools. After implementation, times dropped to:

Todo:
Figure out why the Dex Per Turn upgrades to have 3 magnitude instead of 2
