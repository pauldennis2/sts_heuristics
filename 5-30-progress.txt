Keeping track of which methods produce the best results

Recertify HOF

Added confirmation for cross-breeding. 

Thus far unable to determine how the "bad numbers" got in. (i.e. why Hall of Fame strats claimed average attainement in mid-50s but when tested actually came closer to 20.
Best theory: the fact that AdaptiveStrategy was missing a hashCode() method screwed things up. This is fixed now. 

Major accomplishments:

1. I think I fixed the concurrency problems (more testing remains to be done)

2. Added the "helped count" data to see which methods are producing the most results, and merged with the "high water" data into "metadata".
